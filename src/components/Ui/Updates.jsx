Adegbesan was on Wednesday sworn-in with members of his seven-man board along with 35 other sports at the M.K.O Stadium,  Abeokuta by the Director of Sports Iyabode Rotimi who represented the Permanent Secretary. She called for cooperation between the Sports Associations and the Ministry especially as the state prepares for the 2022 National Sports Festival set to be hosted by Delta State from November 2-15.

Other members are: Bimbo Okusanya, Bukunmi Afolayan and Lawrence Adesola while Tayo Ogunseye would serve as the Media Officer with Kehinde Osho as the secretary. The Sheikh as he is fondly called, believed the desire to discover more talents and bring them into national limelight makes it imperative for him to take up the reins in the state. \"It's a great opportunity, you know, to finally get to this point where the new chairmen and the board of sports associations are inaugurated in the state.

It is our aim to succeed and that we will do with the aid of well-meaning individuals and sponsors and every other thing that will make us succeed. \"The catchy thing about Scrabble is, there's a World Scrabble Championship, right? Nigeria has consistently been the best performing country in the world. Scrabble is played in major countries and a  lot of people play Scrabble in their homes, so Scrabble has that listening ears already, so we just need to put some more work and make it a more spectator friendly sports. We're hopeful as everything points to the fact that Scrabble will get to that position where football.\"He said part of the plan was to make the various zones in the state active while competitions would be organised among schools. He also revealed that the association would seek ways of engaging individuals who are out of school.
